# HarmonAIze Coding Exercise

Welcome! This repository contains the technical assessment for backend data engineers applying to work with the HarmonAIze project.

## Overview

This exercise should take about **three hours** to complete. You will build a Django-based backend feature that harmonizes structured data (CSV/YAML) and loads it into a PostgreSQL database using Django models. The exercise tests your skills in schema design, data mapping, and Python backend engineering.

Full instructions and details are provided in `HarmonAIze_Coding_Exercise.md` (sometimes referred to as the lockdown MD file).

## How to Start

1. **Read the full exercise instructions in `HarmonAIze_Coding_Exercise.md`.**
2. Use the provided `/sample_data/` directory for example data and codebooks.
3. Follow the step-by-step checklist in the exercise document.
4. Your main deliverable is a Django-based backend feature that demonstrates data harmonization, ingestion, and schema design.
